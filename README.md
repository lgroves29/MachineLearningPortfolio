### About me

I am a recent graduate of Smith College with a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics, interested in the field of cyber security. 
This portfolio covers some of the work I completed for a Machine Learning course. I have taken several of the ML algorithms covered in the course and applied them to three cyber security tasks: spam filtering, intrusion detection systems, and malware detection.
