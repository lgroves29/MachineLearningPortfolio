# MachineLearningPortfolio


A readme file that both introduces you and synthesizes the elements of the portfolio in a cohesive manner. Your readme should include a brief introduction about you (perhaps in the style of a resume or short cover letter) as well as highlight the following: 
The skills and expertise you have in machine learning
The depth of your knowledge in the field
Your interests beyond machine learning 

### About me

I am a recent graduate of Smith College with a BA in Computer Science and Mathematics, interested in the field of cyber security. 
This portfolio covers some of the work I completed for a Machine Learning course. I have taken several of the ML algorithms covered in the course and applied them to three cyber security tasks: spam filtering, intrusion detection systems, and malware detection.
