# MachineLearningPortfolio


A readme file that both introduces you and synthesizes the elements of the portfolio in a cohesive manner. Your readme should include a brief introduction about you (perhaps in the style of a resume or short cover letter) as well as highlight the following: 
The skills and expertise you have in machine learning
The depth of your knowledge in the field
Your interests beyond machine learning 



Here's the plan:

SVMs, kNN, and Random Forests can all be used in cybersecurity applications such as Intrusion Detection, Spam filtering, and malware detection. I will redo previous labs focusing on each of these algorithms with new datasets relevant to these topics where possible, discussing how they are useful in cyber security.
